1,2,THE STRANGE MAN S ARRIVAL,NO QUOTE,,,,0,1,1.0,1.0
2,3,"The stranger came early in February, one wintry day, through a biting wind and a driving snow, the last snowfall of the year, over the down, walking from Bramblehurst railway station, and carrying a little black portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand. He was wrapped up from head to foot, and the brim of his soft felt hat hid every inch of his face but the shiny tip of his nose; the snow had piled itself against his shoulders and chest, and added a white crest to the burden he carried. He staggered into the  /newquote  more dead than alive, and flung his portmanteau down.  /newquote  he cried,  /newquote  He stamped and shook the snow from off himself in the bar, and followed Mrs. Hall into her guest parlour to strike his bargain. And with that much introduction, that and a couple of sovereigns flung upon the table, he took up his quarters in the inn.","Coach and Horses /newquote A fire, /newquote in the name of human charity! A room and a fire!",The Invisible Man,['Mrs. Hall'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he cried
3,4,"Mrs. Hall lit the fire and left him there while she went to prepare him a meal with her own hands. A guest to stop at Iping in the wintertime was an unheard-of piece of luck, let alone a guest who was no  /newquote  and she was resolved to show herself worthy of her good fortune. As soon as the bacon was well under way, and Millie, her lymphatic maid, had been brisked up a bit by a few deftly chosen expressions of contempt, she carried the cloth, plates, and glasses into the parlour and began to lay them with the utmost _ clat_. Although the fire was burning up briskly, she was surprised to see that her visitor still wore his hat and coat, standing with his back to her and staring out of the window at the falling snow in the yard. His gloved hands were clasped behind him, and he seemed to be lost in thought. She noticed that the melting snow that still sprinkled his shoulders dripped upon her carpet.  /newquote  she said, ","haggler, /newquote Can I take your hat and coat, sir? /newquote and give them a good dry in the kitchen?",Mrs. Hall,['The Invisible Man'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,she said

6,7,"He turned his head and looked at her over his shoulder.  /newquote  he said with emphasis, and she noticed that he wore big blue spectacles with sidelights, and had a bush side-whisker over his coat-collar that completely hid his cheeks and face.","I prefer to keep them on,",The Invisible Man,['Mrs. Hall'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he said
7,8, she said. ,"Very well, sir, /newquote _As_ you like. In a bit the room will be warmer.",Mrs. Hall,['The Invisible Man'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,she said
8,9,"He made no answer, and had turned his face away from her again, and Mrs. Hall, feeling that her conversational advances were ill-timed, laid the rest of the table things in a quick staccato and whisked out of the room. When she returned he was still standing there, like a man of stone, his back hunched, his collar turned up, his dripping hat-brim turned down, hiding his face and ears completely. She put down the eggs and bacon with considerable emphasis, and called rather than said to him, ","Your lunch is served, sir.",Mrs. Hall,['The Invisible Man'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,She put down the eggs and bacon with considerable emphasis and called rather than said to him
9,10," he said at the same time, and did not stir until she was closing the door. Then he swung round and approached the table with a certain eager quickness.","Thank you,",The Invisible Man,['Mrs. Hall'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he said
10,11,"As she went behind the bar to the kitchen she heard a sound repeated at regular intervals. Chirk, chirk, chirk, it went, the sound of a spoon being rapidly whisked round a basin.  /newquote  she said.  /newquote  And while she herself finished mixing the mustard, she gave Millie a few verbal stabs for her excessive slowness. She had cooked the ham and eggs, laid the table, and done everything, while Millie (help indeed!) had only succeeded in delaying the mustard. And him a new guest and wanting to stay! Then she filled the mustard pot, and, putting it with a certain stateliness upon a gold and black tea-tray, carried it into the parlour.",That girl! /newquote There! I clean forgot it. It s her being so long!,Mrs. Hall,[],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,she said
11,12,"She rapped and entered promptly. As she did so her visitor moved quickly, so that she got but a glimpse of a white object disappearing behind the table. It would seem he was picking something from the floor. She rapped down the mustard pot on the table, and then she noticed the overcoat and hat had been taken off and put over a chair in front of the fire, and a pair of wet boots threatened rust to her steel fender. She went to these things resolutely.  /newquote  she said in a voice that brooked no denial.","I suppose I may have them to dry now,",Mrs. Hall,['The Invisible Man'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,she said
12,13," said her visitor, in a muffled voice, and turning she saw he had raised his head and was sitting and looking at her.","Leave the hat,",The Invisible Man,['Mrs. Hall'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,said her visitor
13,14,"For a moment she stood gaping at him, too surprised to speak.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,1,1.0,1.0
14,15,"He held a white cloth it was a serviette he had brought with him over the lower part of his face, so that his mouth and jaws were completely hidden, and that was the reason of his muffled voice. But it was not that which startled Mrs. Hall. It was the fact that all his forehead above his blue glasses was covered by a white bandage, and that another covered his ears, leaving not a scrap of his face exposed excepting only his pink, peaked nose. It was bright, pink, and shiny just as it had been at first. He wore a dark-brown velvet jacket with a high, black, linen-lined collar turned up about his neck. The thick black hair, escaping as it could below and between the cross bandages, projected in curious tails and horns, giving him the strangest appearance conceivable. This muffled and bandaged head was so unlike what she had anticipated, that for a moment she was rigid.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,1,1.0,1.0
15,16,"He did not remove the serviette, but remained holding it, as she saw now, with a brown gloved hand, and regarding her with his inscrutable blue glasses.  /newquote  he said, speaking very distinctly through the white cloth.","Leave the hat,",The Invisible Man,['Mrs. Hall'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,said her visitor
16,17,"Her nerves began to recover from the shock they had received. She placed the hat on the chair again by the fire.  /newquote  she began,  /newquote  and she stopped embarrassed.","I didn t know, sir, /newquote that ",Mrs. Hall,['The Invisible Man'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,she began
17,18," he said drily, glancing from her to the door and then at her again.","Thank you,",The Invisible Man,['Mrs. Hall'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he said
18,19," she said, and carried his clothes out of the room. She glanced at his white-swathed head and blue goggles again as she was going out of the door; but his napkin was still in front of his face. She shivered a little as she closed the door behind her, and her face was eloquent of her surprise and perplexity.  /newquote  she whispered.  /newquote  She went quite softly to the kitchen, and was too preoccupied to ask Millie what she was messing about with _now_, when she got there.","I ll have them nicely dried, sir, at once, /newquote I _never_, /newquote There!",Mrs. Hall,['The Invisible Man'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,she said
19,20,"The visitor sat and listened to her retreating feet. He glanced inquiringly at the window before he removed his serviette, and resumed his meal. He took a mouthful, glanced suspiciously at the window, took another mouthful, then rose and, taking the serviette in his hand, walked across the room and pulled the blind down to the top of the white muslin that obscured the lower panes. This left the room in a twilight. This done, he returned with an easier air to the table and his meal.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,1,1.0,1.0
20,21, said Mrs. Hall. ,"The poor soul s had an accident or an op ration or somethin , /newquote What a turn them bandages did give me, to be sure!",Mrs. Hall,[],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Explicit,said Mrs Hall
21,22,"She put on some more coal, unfolded the clothes-horse, and extended the traveller s coat upon this.  /newquote  She hung his muffler on a corner of the horse. ","And they goggles! Why, he looked more like a divin  helmet than a human man! /newquote And holding that handkerchief over his mouth all the time. Talkin  through it! ... Perhaps his mouth was hurt too maybe.",Mrs. Hall,[],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Implicit,
22,23,"She turned round, as one who suddenly remembers.  /newquote  she said, going off at a tangent; ","Bless my soul alive! /newquote ain t you done them taters _yet_, Millie?",Mrs. Hall,[],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,she said
23,24,"When Mrs. Hall went to clear away the stranger s lunch, her idea that his mouth must also have been cut or disfigured in the accident she supposed him to have suffered, was confirmed, for he was smoking a pipe, and all the time that she was in the room he never loosened the silk muffler he had wrapped round the lower part of his face to put the mouthpiece to his lips. Yet it was not forgetfulness, for she saw he glanced at it as it smouldered out. He sat in the corner with his back to the window-blind and spoke now, having eaten and drunk and being comfortably warmed through, with less aggressive brevity than before. The reflection of the fire lent a kind of red animation to his big spectacles they had lacked hitherto.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,1,1.0,1.0
24,25," he said,  /newquote  and he asked her how he could have it sent. He bowed his bandaged head quite politely in acknowledgment of her explanation.  /newquote  he said.  /newquote  and seemed quite disappointed when she answered,  /newquote  Was she quite sure? No man with a trap who would go over?","I have some luggage, /newquote at Bramblehurst station, /newquote To-morrow? /newquote There is no speedier delivery? /newquote No.",The Invisible Man,['Mrs. Hall'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he said
25,26,"Mrs. Hall, nothing loath, answered his questions and developed a conversation.  /newquote  she said in answer to the question about a trap; and then, snatching at an opening, said, ","It s a steep road by the down, sir, /newquote It was there a carriage was upsettled, a year ago and more. A gentleman killed, besides his coachman.

26,27,"But the visitor was not to be drawn so easily.  /newquote  he said through his muffler, eyeing her quietly through his impenetrable glasses.","They do,",The Invisible Man,['Mrs. Hall'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he said

30,31,"The visitor laughed abruptly, a bark of a laugh that he seemed to bite and kill in his mouth.  /newquote  he said.",_Was_ he?,The Invisible Man,['Mrs. Hall'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he said
31,32,NO APPEND,"He was, sir. And no laughing matter to them as had the doing for him, as I had my sister being took up with her little ones so much. There was bandages to do, sir, and bandages to undo. So that if I may make so bold as to say it, sir ",Mrs. Hall,['The Invisible Man'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Implicit,
32,33," said the visitor, quite abruptly. ",Will you get me some matches? /newquote My pipe is out.,The Invisible Man,['Mrs. Hall'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,said the visitor
33,34,"Mrs. Hall was pulled up suddenly. It was certainly rude of him, after telling him all she had done. She gasped at him for a moment, and remembered the two sovereigns. She went for the matches.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,1,1.0,1.0
34,35," he said concisely, as she put them down, and turned his shoulder upon her and stared out of the window again. It was altogether too discouraging. Evidently he was sensitive on the topic of operations and bandages. She did not  /newquote  however, after all. But his snubbing way had irritated her, and Millie had a hot time of it that afternoon.","Thanks, /newquote make so bold as to say,",Mrs. Hall,['The Invisible Man'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Implicit,
35,36,"The visitor remained in the parlour until four o clock, without giving the ghost of an excuse for an intrusion. For the most part he was quite still during that time; it would seem he sat in the growing darkness smoking in the firelight perhaps dozing.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,1,1.0,1.0
36,37,"Once or twice a curious listener might have heard him at the coals, and for the space of five minutes he was audible pacing the room. He seemed to be talking to himself. Then the armchair creaked as he sat down again.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,1,1.0,1.0

38,39,"At four o clock, when it was fairly dark and Mrs. Hall was screwing up her courage to go in and ask her visitor if he would take some tea, Teddy Henfrey, the clock-jobber, came into the bar.  /newquote  said he,  /newquote  The snow outside was falling faster.","My sakes! Mrs. Hall, /newquote but this is terrible weather for thin boots!",Mr. Teddy Henfrey,['Mrs. Hall'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,2,Anaphoric,said he
39,40,"Mrs. Hall agreed, and then noticed he had his bag with him.  /newquote  said she, ","Now you re here, Mr. Teddy, /newquote I d be glad if you d give th  old clock in the parlour a bit of a look.  Tis going, and it strikes well and hearty; but the hour-hand won t do nuthin  but point at six.",Mrs. Hall,['Mr. Teddy Henfrey'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,2,Anaphoric,said she
40,41,"And leading the way, she went across to the parlour door and rapped and entered.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,2,1.0,1.0
41,42,"Her visitor, she saw as she opened the door, was seated in the armchair before the fire, dozing it would seem, with his bandaged head drooping on one side. The only light in the room was the red glow from the fire which lit his eyes like adverse railway signals, but left his downcast face in darkness and the scanty vestiges of the day that came in through the open door. Everything was ruddy, shadowy, and indistinct to her, the more so since she had just been lighting the bar lamp, and her eyes were dazzled. But for a second it seemed to her that the man she looked at had an enormous mouth wide open a vast and incredible mouth that swallowed the whole of the lower portion of his face. It was the sensation of a moment: the white-bound head, the monstrous goggle eyes, and this huge yawn below it. Then he stirred, started up in his chair, put up his hand. She opened the door wide, so that the room was lighter, and she saw him more clearly, with the muffler held up to his face just as she had seen him hold the serviette before. The shadows, she fancied, had tricked her.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,2,1.0,1.0
42,43," she said, recovering from the momentary shock.","Would you mind, sir, this man a-coming to look at the clock, sir?",Mrs. Hall,['The Invisible Man'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,2,Anaphoric,she said
43,44," he said, staring round in a drowsy manner, and speaking over his hand, and then, getting more fully awake, ",Look at the clock? /newquote certainly.,The Invisible Man,['Mrs. Hall'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,2,Anaphoric,he said
44,45,"Mrs. Hall went away to get a lamp, and he rose and stretched himself. Then came the light, and Mr. Teddy Henfrey, entering, was confronted by this bandaged person. He was, he says, ",taken aback.,Mr. Teddy Henfrey,[],NO MONOLOGUE,0,2,Anaphoric,he says

50,51," he said, seeing a certain hesitation in Mr. Henfrey s manner.  /newquote  Mr. Henfrey had intended to apologise and withdraw, but this anticipation reassured him. The stranger turned round with his back to the fireplace and put his hands behind his back.  /newquote  he said, ","But I m really glad to have the clock seen to, /newquote Very glad. /newquote And presently, /newquote when the clock-mending is over, I think I should like to have some tea.

51,52,"Mrs. Hall was about to leave the room she made no conversational advances this time, because she did not want to be snubbed in front of Mr. Henfrey when her visitor asked her if she had made any arrangements about his boxes at Bramblehurst. She told him she had mentioned the matter to the postman, and that the carrier could bring them over on the morrow.  /newquote  he said.",You are certain that is the earliest?,The Invisible Man,"['Mr. Teddy Henfrey', 'Mrs. Hall']",NO MONOLOGUE,0,2,Anaphoric,he said

60,61, said Mrs. Hall to herself.,"I thought as much,",Mrs. Hall,['Mrs. Hall'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,2,Explicit,said Mrs Hall to herself
61,62,NO APPEND," necessitates a certain retirement. My eyes are sometimes so weak and painful that I have to shut myself up in the dark for hours together. Lock myself up. Sometimes now and then.

63,64," said the stranger, with that quietly irresistible air of finality he could assume at will. Mrs. Hall reserved her question and sympathy for a better occasion.","That I think, is all,",The Invisible Man,"['Mr. Teddy Henfrey', 'Mrs. Hall']",NO MONOLOGUE,0,2,Explicit,said the stranger
64,65,"After Mrs. Hall had left the room, he remained standing in front of the fire, glaring, so Mr. Henfrey puts it, at the clock-mending. Mr. Henfrey not only took off the hands of the clock, and the face, but extracted the works; and he tried to work in as slow and quiet and unassuming a manner as possible. He worked with the lamp close to him, and the green shade threw a brilliant light upon his hands, and upon the frame and wheels, and left the rest of the room shadowy. When he looked up, coloured patches swam in his eyes. Being constitutionally of a curious nature, he had removed the works a quite unnecessary proceeding with the idea of delaying his departure and perhaps falling into conversation with the stranger. But the stranger stood there, perfectly silent and still. So still, it got on Henfrey s nerves. He felt alone in the room and looked up, and there, grey and dim, was the bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly, with a mist of green spots drifting in front of them. It was so uncanny to Henfrey that for a minute they remained staring blankly at one another. Then Henfrey looked down again. Very uncomfortable position! One would like to say something. Should he remark that the weather was very cold for the time of year?",NO QUOTE,,,,0,2,1.0,1.0

But the seed of suspicion Teddy had sown germinated in the mind of Mr. Hall in spite of these discouragements.  /newquote  said Mr. Hall, resolved to ascertain more about the personality of his guest at the earliest possible opportunity. And after the stranger had gone to bed, which he did about half-past nine, Mr. Hall went very aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard at his wife s furniture, just to show that the stranger wasn t master there, and scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of mathematical computations the stranger had left.

84,85,"So it was that on the twenty-ninth day of February, at the beginning of the thaw, this singular person fell out of infinity into Iping village. Next day his luggage arrived through the slush and very remarkable luggage it was. There were a couple of trunks indeed, such as a rational man might need, but in addition there were a box of books big, fat books, of which some were just in an incomprehensible handwriting and a dozen or more crates, boxes, and cases, containing objects packed in straw, as it seemed to Hall, tugging with a casual curiosity at the straw glass bottles. The stranger, muffled in hat, coat, gloves, and wrapper, came out impatiently to meet Fearenside s cart, while Hall was having a word or so of gossip preparatory to helping bring them in.

But excepting two odd incidents, the circumstances of his stay until the extraordinary day of the club festival may be passed over very cursorily. There were a number of skirmishes with Mrs. Hall on matters of domestic discipline, but in every case until late April, when the first signs of penury began, he over-rode her by the easy expedient of an extra payment. Hall did not like him, and whenever he dared he talked of the advisability of getting rid of him; but he showed his dislike chiefly by concealing it ostentatiously, and avoiding his visitor as much as possible.  /newquote  said Mrs. Hall sagely, ","Wait till the summer, /newquote when the artisks are beginning to come.

128,129,"The stranger did not go to church, and indeed made no difference between Sunday and the irreligious days, even in costume. He worked, as Mrs. Hall thought, very fitfully. Some days he would come down early and be continuously busy. On others he would rise late, pace his room, fretting audibly for hours together, smoke, sleep in the armchair by the fire. Communication with the world beyond the village he had none. His temper continued very uncertain; for the most part his manner was that of a man suffering under almost unendurable provocation, and once or twice things were snapped, torn, crushed, or broken in spasmodic gusts of violence. He seemed under a chronic irritation of the greatest intensity.

When asked what an experimental investigator was, she would say with a touch of superiority that most educated people knew such things as that, and would thus explain that he  /newquote  Her visitor had had an accident, she said, which temporarily discoloured his face and hands, and being of a sensitive disposition, he was averse to any public notice of the fact.","experimental investigator, /newquote discovered things.",Mrs. Hall,[],NO MONOLOGUE,0,4,Anaphoric,she explained
131,132,"Out of her hearing there was a view largely entertained that he was a criminal trying to escape from justice by wrapping himself up so as to conceal himself altogether from the eye of the police. This idea sprang from the brain of Mr. Teddy Henfrey. No crime of any magnitude dating from the middle or end of February was known to have occurred. Elaborated in the imagination of Mr. Gould, the probationary assistant in the National School, this theory took the form that the stranger was an Anarchist in disguise, preparing explosives, and he resolved to undertake such detective operations as his time permitted. These consisted for the most part in looking very hard at the stranger whenever they met, or in asking people who had never seen the stranger, leading questions about him.

They drew aside as he passed down the village, and when he had gone by, young humourists would up with coat-collars and down with hat-brims, and go pacing nervously after him in imitation of his occult bearing. There was a song popular at that time called  /newquote . Miss Statchell sang it at the schoolroom concert (in aid of the church lamps), and thereafter whenever one or two of the villagers were gathered together and the stranger appeared, a bar or so of this tune, more or less sharp or flat, was whistled in the midst of them.

Either a body absorbs light, or it reflects or refracts it, or does all these things. If it neither reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light, it cannot of itself be visible. You see an opaque red box, for instance, because the colour absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest, all the red part of the light, to you. If it did not absorb any particular part of the light, but reflected it all, then it would be a shining white box. Silver! A diamond box would neither absorb much of the light nor reflect much from the general surface, but just here and there where the surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and refracted, so that you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing reflections and translucencies a sort of skeleton of light. A glass box would not be so brilliant, nor so clearly visible, as a diamond box, because there would be less refraction and reflection. See that? From certain points of view you would see quite clearly through it. Some kinds of glass would be more visible than others, a box of flint glass would be brighter than a box of ordinary window glass. A box of very thin common glass would be hard to see in a bad light, because it would absorb hardly any light and refract and reflect very little. And if you put a sheet of common white glass in water, still more if you put it in some denser liquid than water, it would vanish almost altogether, because light passing from water to glass is only slightly refracted or reflected or indeed affected in any way. It is almost as invisible as a jet of coal gas or hydrogen is in air. And for precisely the same reason!",The Invisible Man,['Kemp'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,19,Explicit,said Griffin

754,755,NO APPEND,"And here is another fact you will know to be true. If a sheet of glass is smashed, Kemp, and beaten into a powder, it becomes much more visible while it is in the air; it becomes at last an opaque white powder. This is because the powdering multiplies the surfaces of the glass at which refraction and reflection occur. In the sheet of glass there are only two surfaces; in the powder the light is reflected or refracted by each grain it passes through, and very little gets right through the powder. But if the white powdered glass is put into water, it forthwith vanishes.

Nevertheless, I was half-minded to accost some passer-by and throw myself upon his mercy. But I knew too clearly the terror and brutal cruelty my advances would evoke. I made no plans in the street.

I had thought I should find the doors open, but they were closed, and as I stood in the wide entrance a carriage stopped outside, and a man in uniform you know the kind of personage with  Omnium  on his cap flung open the door.

The place was already lit up and agreeably warm, and I decided to remain where I was, keeping a cautious eye on the two or three sets of shopmen and customers who were meandering through the place, until closing time came. Then I should be able, I thought, to rob the place for food and clothing, and disguised, prowl through it and examine its resources, perhaps sleep on some of the bedding. That seemed an acceptable plan. My idea was to procure clothing to make myself a muffled but acceptable figure, to get money, and then to recover my books and parcels where they awaited me, take a lodging somewhere and elaborate plans for the complete realisation of the advantages my invisibility gave me (as I still imagined) over my fellow-men.",The Invisible Man,['Kemp'],NO MONOLOGUE,0,22,Implicit,

It could not have been more than an hour after I took up my position on the mattresses before I noticed the blinds of the windows being drawn, and customers being marched doorward. And then a number of brisk young men began with remarkable alacrity to tidy up the goods that remained disturbed. I left my lair as the crowds diminished, and prowled cautiously out into the less desolate parts of the shop. I was really surprised to observe how rapidly the young men and women whipped away the goods displayed for sale during the day. All the boxes of goods, the hanging fabrics, the festoons of lace, the boxes of sweets in the grocery section, the displays of this and that, were being whipped down, folded up, slapped into tidy receptacles, and everything that could not be taken down and put away had sheets of some coarse stuff like sacking flung over them. Finally all the chairs were turned up on to the counters, leaving the floor clear. Directly each of these young people had done, he or she made promptly for the door with such an expression of animation as I have rarely observed in a shop assistant before. Then came a lot of youngsters scattering sawdust and carrying pails and brooms. I had to dodge to get out of the way, and as it was, my ankle got stung with the sawdust. For some time, wandering through the swathed and darkened departments, I could hear the brooms at work. And at last a good hour or more after the shop had been closed, came a noise of locking doors. Silence came upon the place, and I found myself wandering through the vast and intricate shops, galleries, show-rooms of the place, alone.

I lapsed into disorderly dreams of all the fantastic things that had happened during the last few days. I saw the ugly little Jew of a landlord vociferating in his rooms; I saw his two sons marvelling, and the wrinkled old woman s gnarled face as she asked for her cat.

995,996,"The Invisible Man seems to have rushed out of Kemp s house in a state of blind fury. A little child playing near Kemp s gateway was violently caught up and thrown aside, so that its ankle was broken, and thereafter for some hours the Invisible Man passed out of human perceptions. No one knows where he went nor what he did. But one can imagine him hurrying through the hot June forenoon, up the hill and on to the open downland behind Port Burdock, raging and despairing at his intolerable fate, and sheltering at last, heated and weary, amid the thickets of Hintondean, to piece together again his shattered schemes against his species. That seems the most probable refuge for him, for there it was he re-asserted himself in a grimly tragical manner about two in the afternoon.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,26,1.0,1.0
996,997,"One wonders what his state of mind may have been during that time, and what plans he devised. No doubt he was almost ecstatically exasperated by Kemp s treachery, and though we may be able to understand the motives that led to that deceit, we may still imagine and even sympathise a little with the fury the attempted surprise must have occasioned. Perhaps something of the stunned astonishment of his Oxford Street experiences may have returned to him, for he had evidently counted on Kemp s co-operation in his brutal dream of a terrorised world. At any rate he vanished from human ken about midday, and no living witness can tell what he did until about half-past two. It was a fortunate thing, perhaps, for humanity, but for him it was a fatal inaction.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,26,1.0,1.0
997,998,"During that time a growing multitude of men scattered over the countryside were busy. In the morning he had still been simply a legend, a terror; in the afternoon, by virtue chiefly of Kemp s drily worded proclamation, he was presented as a tangible antagonist, to be wounded, captured, or overcome, and the countryside began organising itself with inconceivable rapidity. By two o clock even he might still have removed himself out of the district by getting aboard a train, but after two that became impossible. Every passenger train along the lines on a great parallelogram between Southampton, Manchester, Brighton and Horsham, travelled with locked doors, and the goods traffic was almost entirely suspended. And in a great circle of twenty miles round Port Burdock, men armed with guns and bludgeons were presently setting out in groups of three and four, with dogs, to beat the roads and fields.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,26,1.0,1.0
998,999,"Mounted policemen rode along the country lanes, stopping at every cottage and warning the people to lock up their houses, and keep indoors unless they were armed, and all the elementary schools had broken up by three o clock, and the children, scared and keeping together in groups, were hurrying home. Kemp s proclamation signed indeed by Adye was posted over almost the whole district by four or five o clock in the afternoon. It gave briefly but clearly all the conditions of the struggle, the necessity of keeping the Invisible Man from food and sleep, the necessity for incessant watchfulness and for a prompt attention to any evidence of his movements. And so swift and decided was the action of the authorities, so prompt and universal was the belief in this strange being, that before nightfall an area of several hundred square miles was in a stringent state of siege. And before nightfall, too, a thrill of horror went through the whole watching nervous countryside. Going from whispering mouth to mouth, swift and certain over the length and breadth of the country, passed the story of the murder of Mr. Wicksteed.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,26,1.0,1.0
999,1000,"If our supposition that the Invisible Man s refuge was the Hintondean thickets, then we must suppose that in the early afternoon he sallied out again bent upon some project that involved the use of a weapon. We cannot know what the project was, but the evidence that he had the iron rod in hand before he met Wicksteed is to me at least overwhelming.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,26,1.0,1.0
1000,1001,"Of course we can know nothing of the details of that encounter. It occurred on the edge of a gravel pit, not two hundred yards from Lord Burdock s lodge gate. Everything points to a desperate struggle the trampled ground, the numerous wounds Mr. Wicksteed received, his splintered walking-stick; but why the attack was made, save in a murderous frenzy, it is impossible to imagine. Indeed the theory of madness is almost unavoidable. Mr. Wicksteed was a man of forty-five or forty-six, steward to Lord Burdock, of inoffensive habits and appearance, the very last person in the world to provoke such a terrible antagonist. Against him it would seem the Invisible Man used an iron rod dragged from a broken piece of fence. He stopped this quiet man, going quietly home to his midday meal, attacked him, beat down his feeble defences, broke his arm, felled him, and smashed his head to a jelly.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,26,1.0,1.0
1001,1002,"Of course, he must have dragged this rod out of the fencing before he met his victim he must have been carrying it ready in his hand. Only two details beyond what has already been stated seem to bear on the matter. One is the circumstance that the gravel pit was not in Mr. Wicksteed s direct path home, but nearly a couple of hundred yards out of his way. The other is the assertion of a little girl to the effect that, going to her afternoon school, she saw the murdered man  /newquote  in a peculiar manner across a field towards the gravel pit. Her pantomime of his action suggests a man pursuing something on the ground before him and striking at it ever and again with his walking-stick. She was the last person to see him alive.

1002,1003,"Now this, to the present writer s mind at least, lifts the murder out of the realm of the absolutely wanton. We may imagine that Griffin had taken the rod as a weapon indeed, but without any deliberate intention of using it in murder. Wicksteed may then have come by and noticed this rod inexplicably moving through the air. Without any thought of the Invisible Man for Port Burdock is ten miles away he may have pursued it. It is quite conceivable that he may not even have heard of the Invisible Man. One can then imagine the Invisible Man making off quietly in order to avoid discovering his presence in the neighbourhood, and Wicksteed, excited and curious, pursuing this unaccountably locomotive object finally striking at it.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,26,1.0,1.0
1003,1004,"No doubt the Invisible Man could easily have distanced his middle-aged pursuer under ordinary circumstances, but the position in which Wicksteed s body was found suggests that he had the ill luck to drive his quarry into a corner between a drift of stinging nettles and the gravel pit. To those who appreciate the extraordinary irascibility of the Invisible Man, the rest of the encounter will be easy to imagine.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,26,1.0,1.0
1004,1005,"But this is pure hypothesis. The only undeniable facts for stories of children are often unreliable are the discovery of Wicksteed s body, done to death, and of the blood-stained iron rod flung among the nettles. The abandonment of the rod by Griffin, suggests that in the emotional excitement of the affair, the purpose for which he took it if he had a purpose was abandoned. He was certainly an intensely egotistical and unfeeling man, but the sight of his victim, his first victim, bloody and pitiful at his feet, may have released some long pent fountain of remorse which for a time may have flooded whatever scheme of action he had contrived.",NO QUOTE,,,,0,26,1.0,1.0
1005,1006,"After the murder of Mr. Wicksteed, he would seem to have struck across the country towards the downland. There is a story of a voice heard about sunset by a couple of men in a field near Fern Bottom. It was wailing and laughing, sobbing and groaning, and ever and again it shouted.

1006,1007,"That afternoon the Invisible Man must have learnt something of the rapid use Kemp had made of his confidences. He must have found houses locked and secured; he may have loitered about railway stations and prowled about inns, and no doubt he read the proclamations and realised something of the nature of the campaign against him. And as the evening advanced, the fields became dotted here and there with groups of three or four men, and noisy with the yelping of dogs. These men-hunters had particular instructions in the case of an encounter as to the way they should support one another. But he avoided them all. We may understand something of his exasperation, and it could have been none the less because he himself had supplied the information that was being used so remorselessly against him. For that day at least he lost heart; for nearly twenty-four hours, save when he turned on Wicksteed, he was a hunted man.
