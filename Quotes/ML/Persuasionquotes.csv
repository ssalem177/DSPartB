24,24,24,25,"But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these.  Her father was growing distressed for money.  She knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  The Kellynch property was good, but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required in its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method, moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income; but with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible for him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his daughter.  He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town; he had gone so far even as to say,  /newquote  and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom.  But these measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards.  Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy.

She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady, a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.   /newquote  said Mrs Smith, ","And she, /newquote besides nursing me most admirably, has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.

She had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those who can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.  She always takes the right time for applying.  Everybody's heart is open, you know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering the blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to speak.  She is a shrewd, intelligent, sensible woman.  Hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she has a fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received 'the best education in the world,' know nothing worth attending to.  Call it gossip, if you will, but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour's leisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable: something that makes one know one's species better.

You must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which, as you well know, affords little to write about.  We have had a very dull Christmas; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays.  I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody.  The holidays, however, are over at last:  I believe no children ever had such long ones.  I am sure I had not.  The house was cleared yesterday, except of the little Harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home.  Mrs Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long.  I do not understand it.  They are not at all nice children, in my opinion; but Mrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren.  What dreadful weather we have had!  It may not be felt in Bath, with your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence.  I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January, except Charles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome.  Between ourselves, I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way.  The carriage is gone to-day, to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow.  We are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after, Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey, which is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of her; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.  I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted with him too; but I have my usual luck:  I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on; always the last of my family to be noticed.  What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying with Elizabeth!  Does she never mean to go away?  But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited.  Let me know what you think of this.  I do not expect my children to be asked, you know.  I can leave them at the Great House very well, for a month or six weeks.  I have this moment heard that the Crofts are going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral gouty.  Charles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.  I do not think they improve at all as neighbours.

In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday, offering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed, addressed to me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as I like.  The Admiral does not seem very ill, and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants.  I shall be truly glad to have them back again.  Our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant family.  But now for Louisa.  I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little.  She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening we went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had been invited as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the reason?  Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa, and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.  True, upon my honour!  Are not you astonished?  I shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it, for I never did.  Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.  We are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick is expected to-day.  Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister's account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite with both.  Indeed, Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her.  Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say; but if you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa; I never could see anything of it.  And this is the end, you see, of Captain Benwick's being supposed to be an admirer of yours.  How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me.

We were principally in town, living in very good style.  He was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one; he had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman.  He had always a home with us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.

That was his motive for drawing back, I can assure you.  He told me the whole story.  He had no concealments with me.

All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself.  Depend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it.  His chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt.

He saw you then at Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot, and from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in his visits there.  But there was another, and an earlier, which I will now explain.  If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable, stop me.  My account states, that your sister's friend, the lady now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter's acquaintance, of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger.",Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,NO MONOLOGUE,0,21,Explicit,continued Mrs Smith,0.998127632634108,0.3253987594868436

Now you are to understand, that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's opinions as to the value of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man.  Having long had as much money as he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to.  I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.  He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William.  You may guess, therefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady if he found it material.  This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could.  He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.  Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival added another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.  He omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way, called at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.

But since he must be absent some time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence.  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea, as nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.  A scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.
