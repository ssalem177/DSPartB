Mr Elliot had attempted no apology, and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between them had ceased.","For they must have been seen together, /newquote once at Tattersall's, and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons.",Sir Walter Elliot,_unknowable,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he observed

She knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  The Kellynch property was good, but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required in its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method, moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income; but with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible for him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his daughter.  He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town; he had gone so far even as to say,  /newquote  and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom.  But these measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards.  Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy.  She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.",Can we retrench?

What will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families have done, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in his case; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering, as it always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing.  We must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who has contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father, there is still more due to the character of an honest man.",Lady Russell,Anne Elliot,NO MONOLOGUE,0,2,Explicit,said Lady Russell

We were principally in town, living in very good style.  He was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one; he had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman.  He had always a home with us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.

That was his motive for drawing back, I can assure you.  He told me the whole story.  He had no concealments with me.

All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself.  Depend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it.  His chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt.  I have often heard him declare, that if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his for fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say on that subject.

850,850,850,851," continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, ","Well, /newquote grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted.  He saw you then at Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot, and from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in his visits there.  But there was another, and an earlier, which I will now explain.  If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable, stop me.  My account states, that your sister's friend, the lady now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter's acquaintance, of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger.",Mrs Smith,[],NO MONOLOGUE,0,21,Explicit,continued Mrs Smith
852,852,852,853,NO APPEND,"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family, long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then visit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas, Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things, and the reports beginning to prevail.  Now you are to understand, that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's opinions as to the value of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man.  Having long had as much money as he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to.  I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.  He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William.  You may guess, therefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady if he found it material.  This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could.  He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.  Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival added another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.  He omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way, called at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.  You can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide, perhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do.",Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,NO MONOLOGUE,0,21,Anaphoric,she continued

I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot, who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never been satisfied.  I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared.

Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea, as nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.  A scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.  'Why, to be sure, ma'am,' said she, 'it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.' And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart, is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter's making a second match.
