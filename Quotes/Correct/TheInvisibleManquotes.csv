2,2,3,"The stranger came early in February, one wintry day, through a biting wind and a driving snow, the last snowfall of the year, over the down, walking from Bramblehurst railway station, and carrying a little black portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand. He was wrapped up from head to foot, and the brim of his soft felt hat hid every inch of his face but the shiny tip of his nose; the snow had piled itself against his shoulders and chest, and added a white crest to the burden he carried. He staggered into the  /newquote  more dead than alive, and flung his portmanteau down.  /newquote  he cried,  /newquote  He stamped and shook the snow from off himself in the bar, and followed Mrs. Hall into her guest parlour to strike his bargain. And with that much introduction, that and a couple of sovereigns flung upon the table, he took up his quarters in the inn.","Coach and Horses /newquote A fire, /newquote in the name of human charity! A room and a fire!",The Invisible Man,Mrs. Hall,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he cried
3,3,4,"Mrs. Hall lit the fire and left him there while she went to prepare him a meal with her own hands. A guest to stop at Iping in the wintertime was an unheard-of piece of luck, let alone a guest who was no  /newquote  and she was resolved to show herself worthy of her good fortune. As soon as the bacon was well under way, and Millie, her lymphatic maid, had been brisked up a bit by a few deftly chosen expressions of contempt, she carried the cloth, plates, and glasses into the parlour and began to lay them with the utmost _ clat_. Although the fire was burning up briskly, she was surprised to see that her visitor still wore his hat and coat, standing with his back to her and staring out of the window at the falling snow in the yard. His gloved hands were clasped behind him, and he seemed to be lost in thought. She noticed that the melting snow that still sprinkled his shoulders dripped upon her carpet.  /newquote  she said, ","haggler, /newquote Can I take your hat and coat, sir? /newquote and give them a good dry in the kitchen?",Mrs. Hall,The Invisible Man,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,she said
4,4,5, he said without turning.,"No,",The Invisible Man,Mrs. Hall,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he said
6,6,7,"He turned his head and looked at her over his shoulder.  /newquote  he said with emphasis, and she noticed that he wore big blue spectacles with sidelights, and had a bush side-whisker over his coat-collar that completely hid his cheeks and face.","I prefer to keep them on,",The Invisible Man,Mrs. Hall,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he said
7,7,8, she said. ,"Very well, sir, /newquote _As_ you like. In a bit the room will be warmer.",Mrs. Hall,The Invisible Man,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,she said
8,8,9,"He made no answer, and had turned his face away from her again, and Mrs. Hall, feeling that her conversational advances were ill-timed, laid the rest of the table things in a quick staccato and whisked out of the room. When she returned he was still standing there, like a man of stone, his back hunched, his collar turned up, his dripping hat-brim turned down, hiding his face and ears completely. She put down the eggs and bacon with considerable emphasis, and called rather than said to him, ","Your lunch is served, sir.",Mrs. Hall,The Invisible Man,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,She put down the eggs and bacon with considerable emphasis and called rather than said to him
9,9,10," he said at the same time, and did not stir until she was closing the door. Then he swung round and approached the table with a certain eager quickness.","Thank you,",The Invisible Man,Mrs. Hall,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he said
11,11,12,"She rapped and entered promptly. As she did so her visitor moved quickly, so that she got but a glimpse of a white object disappearing behind the table. It would seem he was picking something from the floor. She rapped down the mustard pot on the table, and then she noticed the overcoat and hat had been taken off and put over a chair in front of the fire, and a pair of wet boots threatened rust to her steel fender. She went to these things resolutely.  /newquote  she said in a voice that brooked no denial.","I suppose I may have them to dry now,",Mrs. Hall,The Invisible Man,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,she said
12,12,13," said her visitor, in a muffled voice, and turning she saw he had raised his head and was sitting and looking at her.","Leave the hat,",The Invisible Man,Mrs. Hall,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,said her visitor
15,15,16,"He did not remove the serviette, but remained holding it, as she saw now, with a brown gloved hand, and regarding her with his inscrutable blue glasses.  /newquote  he said, speaking very distinctly through the white cloth.","Leave the hat,",The Invisible Man,Mrs. Hall,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,said her visitor
16,16,17,"Her nerves began to recover from the shock they had received. She placed the hat on the chair again by the fire.  /newquote  she began,  /newquote  and she stopped embarrassed.","I didn t know, sir, /newquote that ",Mrs. Hall,The Invisible Man,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,she began

18,18,19," she said, and carried his clothes out of the room. She glanced at his white-swathed head and blue goggles again as she was going out of the door; but his napkin was still in front of his face. She shivered a little as she closed the door behind her, and her face was eloquent of her surprise and perplexity.  /newquote  she whispered.  /newquote  She went quite softly to the kitchen, and was too preoccupied to ask Millie what she was messing about with _now_, when she got there.","I ll have them nicely dried, sir, at once, /newquote I _never_, /newquote There!",Mrs. Hall,The Invisible Man,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,she said
24,24,25," he said,  /newquote  and he asked her how he could have it sent. He bowed his bandaged head quite politely in acknowledgment of her explanation.  /newquote  he said.  /newquote  and seemed quite disappointed when she answered,  /newquote  Was she quite sure?

25,25,26,"Mrs. Hall, nothing loath, answered his questions and developed a conversation.  /newquote  she said in answer to the question about a trap; and then, snatching at an opening, said, ","It s a steep road by the down, sir, /newquote It was there a carriage was upsettled, a year ago and more. A gentleman killed, besides his coachman.

26,26,27,"But the visitor was not to be drawn so easily.  /newquote  he said through his muffler, eyeing her quietly through his impenetrable glasses.","They do,",The Invisible Man,Mrs. Hall,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he said

31,31,32,NO APPEND,"He was, sir. And no laughing matter to them as had the doing for him, as I had my sister being took up with her little ones so much.

32,32,33," said the visitor, quite abruptly. ",Will you get me some matches? /newquote My pipe is out.,The Invisible Man,Mrs. Hall,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,said the visitor
34,34,35," he said concisely, as she put them down, and turned his shoulder upon her and stared out of the window again. It was altogether too discouraging. Evidently he was sensitive on the topic of operations and bandages. She did not  /newquote  however, after all. But his snubbing way had irritated her, and Millie had a hot time of it that afternoon.","Thanks, /newquote make so bold as to say,",Mrs. Hall,The Invisible Man,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Implicit,
38,38,39,"At four o clock, when it was fairly dark and Mrs. Hall was screwing up her courage to go in and ask her visitor if he would take some tea, Teddy Henfrey, the clock-jobber, came into the bar.  /newquote  said he,  /newquote  The snow outside was falling faster.","My sakes! Mrs. Hall, /newquote but this is terrible weather for thin boots!",Mr. Teddy Henfrey,Mrs. Hall,NO MONOLOGUE,0,2,Anaphoric,said he
39,39,40,"Mrs. Hall agreed, and then noticed he had his bag with him.  /newquote  said she, ","Now you re here, Mr. Teddy, /newquote I d be glad if you d give th  old clock in the parlour a bit of a look.

43,43,44," he said, staring round in a drowsy manner, and speaking over his hand, and then, getting more fully awake, ",Look at the clock? /newquote certainly.,The Invisible Man,Mrs. Hall,NO MONOLOGUE,0,2,Anaphoric,he said
60,60,61, said Mrs. Hall to herself.,"I thought as much,",Mrs. Hall,Mrs. Hall,NO MONOLOGUE,0,2,Explicit,said Mrs Hall to herself

68,68,69,"But he went feeling excessively annoyed.  /newquote  said Mr. Henfrey to himself, trudging down the village through the thawing snow; ","Damn it! /newquote a man must do a clock at times, surely.",Mr. Teddy Henfrey,Mr. Teddy Henfrey,NO MONOLOGUE,0,2,Explicit,said Mr Henfrey to himself
71,71,72,"At Gleeson s corner he saw Hall, who had recently married the stranger s hostess at the  /newquote  and who now drove the Iping conveyance, when occasional people required it, to Sidderbridge Junction, coming towards him on his return from that place.

75,75,76,And he proceeded to give Hall a vivid description of his grotesque guest.  /newquote  said Henfrey. ,"Looks a bit like a disguise, don t it?

78,78,79,He told Hall how his aunt at Hastings had been swindled by a stranger with empty portmanteaux. Altogether he left Hall vaguely suspicious.  /newquote  said Hall. ,"Get up, old girl, /newquote I s pose I must see  bout this.",Mr. Hall,Mr. Teddy Henfrey,NO MONOLOGUE,0,2,Explicit,said Hall
80,80,81,"Instead of  /newquote  however, Hall on his return was severely rated by his wife on the length of time he had spent in Sidderbridge, and his mild inquiries were answered snappishly and in a manner not to the point. But the seed of suspicion Teddy had sown germinated in the mind of Mr. Hall in spite of these discouragements.  /newquote  said Mr. Hall, resolved to ascertain more about the personality of his guest at the earliest possible opportunity. And after the stranger had gone to bed, which he did about half-past nine, Mr. Hall went very aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard at his wife s furniture, just to show that the stranger wasn t master there, and scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of mathematical computations the stranger had left. When retiring for the night he instructed Mrs. Hall to look very closely at the stranger s luggage when it came next day.","seeing  bout it, /newquote You wim  don t know everything,",Mr. Hall,Mrs. Hall,NO MONOLOGUE,0,2,Explicit,said Mr Hall

But excepting two odd incidents, the circumstances of his stay until the extraordinary day of the club festival may be passed over very cursorily. There were a number of skirmishes with Mrs. Hall on matters of domestic discipline, but in every case until late April, when the first signs of penury began, he over-rode her by the easy expedient of an extra payment. Hall did not like him, and whenever he dared he talked of the advisability of getting rid of him; but he showed his dislike chiefly by concealing it ostentatiously, and avoiding his visitor as much as possible.  /newquote  said Mrs. Hall sagely, ","Wait till the summer, /newquote when the artisks are beginning to come.

What are you fishing after?  I apologised. Dignified sniff and cough. He resumed. He d read it. Five ingredients. Put it down; turned his head. Draught of air from window lifted the paper.

In the books the books that tramp has hidden there are marvels, miracles!

752,752,753, said Griffin. ,"Precisely, /newquote But consider, visibility depends on the action of the visible bodies on light. Either a body absorbs light, or it reflects or refracts it, or does all these things. If it neither reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light, it cannot of itself be visible. You see an opaque red box, for instance, because the colour absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest, all the red part of the light, to you. If it did not absorb any particular part of the light, but reflected it all, then it would be a shining white box. Silver! A diamond box would neither absorb much of the light nor reflect much from the general surface, but just here and there where the surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and refracted, so that you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing reflections and translucencies a sort of skeleton of light. A glass box would not be so brilliant, nor so clearly visible, as a diamond box, because there would be less refraction and reflection. See that? From certain points of view you would see quite clearly through it. Some kinds of glass would be more visible than others, a box of flint glass would be brighter than a box of ordinary window glass. A box of very thin common glass would be hard to see in a bad light, because it would absorb hardly any light and refract and reflect very little. And if you put a sheet of common white glass in water, still more if you put it in some denser liquid than water, it would vanish almost altogether, because light passing from water to glass is only slightly refracted or reflected or indeed affected in any way. It is almost as invisible as a jet of coal gas or hydrogen is in air. And for precisely the same reason!",The Invisible Man,Kemp,NO MONOLOGUE,0,19,Explicit,said Griffin

754,754,755,NO APPEND,"And here is another fact you will know to be true. If a sheet of glass is smashed, Kemp, and beaten into a powder, it becomes much more visible while it is in the air; it becomes at last an opaque white powder. This is because the powdering multiplies the surfaces of the glass at which refraction and reflection occur. In the sheet of glass there are only two surfaces; in the powder the light is reflected or refracted by each grain it passes through, and very little gets right through the powder. But if the white powdered glass is put into water, it forthwith vanishes. The powdered glass and water have much the same refractive index; that is, the light undergoes very little refraction or reflection in passing from one to the other.",The Invisible Man,Kemp,NO MONOLOGUE,0,19,Implicit,

Oil white paper, fill up the interstices between the particles with oil so that there is no longer refraction or reflection except at the surfaces, and it becomes as transparent as glass. And not only paper, but cotton fibre, linen fibre, wool fibre, woody fibre, and _bone_, Kemp, _flesh_, Kemp, _hair_, Kemp, _nails_ and _nerves_, Kemp, in fact the whole fabric of a man except the red of his blood and the black pigment of hair, are all made up of transparent, colourless tissue.

I lay awake thinking weak aimless stuff, going over the experiment over and over again, or dreaming feverishly of things growing misty and vanishing about me, until everything, the ground I stood on, vanished, and so I came to that sickly falling nightmare one gets. About two, the cat began miaowing about the room. I tried to hush it by talking to it, and then I decided to turn it out. I remember the shock I had when striking a light there were just the round eyes shining green and nothing round them. I would have given it milk, but I hadn t any. It wouldn t be quiet, it just sat down and miaowed at the door. I tried to catch it, with an idea of putting it out of the window, but it wouldn t be caught, it vanished.

The laws in this country against vivisection were very severe he might be liable. I denied the cat. Then the vibration of the little gas engine could be felt all over the house, he said. That was true, certainly. He edged round me into the room, peering about over his German-silver spectacles, and a sudden dread came into my mind that he might carry away something of my secret. I tried to keep between him and the concentrating apparatus I had arranged, and that only made him more curious. What was I doing? Why was I always alone and secretive? Was it legal? Was it dangerous? I paid nothing but the usual rent. His had always been a most respectable house in a disreputable neighbourhood. Suddenly my temper gave way. I told him to get out.

A happy thought saved me, and as this drove slowly along I followed in its immediate wake, trembling and astonished at the turn of my adventure. And not only trembling, but shivering.

Nevertheless, I was half-minded to accost some passer-by and throw myself upon his mercy. But I knew too clearly the terror and brutal cruelty my advances would evoke. I made no plans in the street. My sole object was to get shelter from the snow, to get myself covered and warm; then I might hope to plan.

I turned down one of the roads leading from Gower Street to Tottenham Court Road, and found myself outside Omniums, the big establishment where everything is to be bought you know the place: meat, grocery, linen, furniture, clothing, oil paintings even a huge meandering collection of shops rather than a shop. I had thought I should find the doors open, but they were closed, and as I stood in the wide entrance a carriage stopped outside, and a man in uniform you know the kind of personage with  Omnium  on his cap flung open the door. I contrived to enter, and walking down the shop it was a department where they were selling ribbons and gloves and stockings and that kind of thing came to a more spacious region devoted to picnic baskets and wicker furniture.",The Invisible Man,Kemp,NO MONOLOGUE,0,22,Implicit,
852,852,853,NO APPEND,"I did not feel safe there, however; people were going to and fro, and I prowled restlessly about until I came upon a huge section in an upper floor containing multitudes of bedsteads, and over these I clambered, and found a resting-place at last among a huge pile of folded flock mattresses. The place was already lit up and agreeably warm, and I decided to remain where I was, keeping a cautious eye on the two or three sets of shopmen and customers who were meandering through the place, until closing time came. Then I should be able, I thought, to rob the place for food and clothing, and disguised, prowl through it and examine its resources, perhaps sleep on some of the bedding. That seemed an acceptable plan. My idea was to procure clothing to make myself a muffled but acceptable figure, to get money, and then to recover my books and parcels where they awaited me, take a lodging somewhere and elaborate plans for the complete realisation of the advantages my invisibility gave me (as I still imagined) over my fellow-men.",The Invisible Man,Kemp,NO MONOLOGUE,0,22,Implicit,
853,853,854,NO APPEND,"Closing time arrived quickly enough. It could not have been more than an hour after I took up my position on the mattresses before I noticed the blinds of the windows being drawn, and customers being marched doorward. And then a number of brisk young men began with remarkable alacrity to tidy up the goods that remained disturbed. I left my lair as the crowds diminished, and prowled cautiously out into the less desolate parts of the shop. I was really surprised to observe how rapidly the young men and women whipped away the goods displayed for sale during the day. All the boxes of goods, the hanging fabrics, the festoons of lace, the boxes of sweets in the grocery section, the displays of this and that, were being whipped down, folded up, slapped into tidy receptacles, and everything that could not be taken down and put away had sheets of some coarse stuff like sacking flung over them. Finally all the chairs were turned up on to the counters, leaving the floor clear. Directly each of these young people had done, he or she made promptly for the door with such an expression of animation as I have rarely observed in a shop assistant before. Then came a lot of youngsters scattering sawdust and carrying pails and brooms. I had to dodge to get out of the way, and as it was, my ankle got stung with the sawdust. For some time, wandering through the swathed and darkened departments, I could hear the brooms at work. And at last a good hour or more after the shop had been closed, came a noise of locking doors. Silence came upon the place, and I found myself wandering through the vast and intricate shops, galleries, show-rooms of the place, alone.

I had to tear down wrappings and ransack a number of boxes and drawers, but at last I managed to turn out what I sought; the box label called them lambswool pants, and lambswool vests. Then socks, a thick comforter, and then I went to the clothing place and got trousers, a lounge jacket, an overcoat and a slouch hat a clerical sort of hat with the brim turned down.

Afterwards, prowling through the place in search of blankets I had to put up at last with a heap of down quilts I came upon a grocery section with a lot of chocolate and candied fruits, more than was good for me indeed and some white burgundy. And near that was a toy department, and I had a brilliant idea. I found some artificial noses dummy noses, you know, and I thought of dark spectacles. But Omniums had no optical department. My nose had been a difficulty indeed I had thought of paint. But the discovery set my mind running on wigs and masks and the like.

I thought that I should be able to slip out unobserved in the morning with my clothes upon me, muffling my face with a white wrapper I had taken, purchase, with the money I had taken, spectacles and so forth, and so complete my disguise. I lapsed into disorderly dreams of all the fantastic things that had happened during the last few days. I saw the ugly little Jew of a landlord vociferating in his rooms; I saw his two sons marvelling, and the wrinkled old woman s gnarled face as she asked for her cat. I experienced again the strange sensation of seeing the cloth disappear, and so I came round to the windy hillside and the sniffing old clergyman mumbling  Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust,  at my father s open grave.",The Invisible Man,Kemp,NO MONOLOGUE,0,22,Implicit,

I struggled, shouted, appealed to the mourners, but they continued stonily following the service; the old clergyman, too, never faltered droning and sniffing through the ritual. I realised I was invisible and inaudible, that overwhelming forces had their grip on me. I struggled in vain, I was forced over the brink, the coffin rang hollow as I fell upon it, and the gravel came flying after me in spadefuls. Nobody heeded me, nobody was aware of me.

I dashed around a corner and came full tilt a faceless figure, mind you! on a lanky lad of fifteen. He yelled and I bowled him over, rushed past him, turned another corner, and by a happy inspiration threw myself behind a counter.

I went behind the counter of this, and waited for my cook, and as he bolted in at the head of the chase, I doubled him up with a lamp. Down he went, and I crouched down behind the counter and began whipping off my clothes as fast as I could. Coat, jacket, trousers, shoes were all right, but a lambswool vest fits a man like a skin.

The insurmountable difficulty of the place, especially now it was alarmed, was to get any plunder out of it. I went down into the warehouse to see if there was any chance of packing and addressing a parcel, but I could not understand the system of checking.

I did not go that way, because of the crowd halfway down it opposite to the still smoking ruins of the house I had fired. My most immediate problem was to get clothing. What to do with my face puzzled me. Then I saw in one of those little miscellaneous shops news, sweets, toys, stationery, belated Christmas tomfoolery, and so forth an array of masks and noses. I realised that problem was solved. In a flash I saw my course. I turned about, no longer aimless, and went circuitously in order to avoid the busy ways, towards the back streets north of the Strand; for I remembered, though not very distinctly where, that some theatrical costumiers had shops in that district.",The Invisible Man,Kemp,NO MONOLOGUE,0,23,Implicit,

Every crossing was a danger, every passenger a thing to watch alertly. One man as I was about to pass him at the top of Bedford Street, turned upon me abruptly and came into me, sending me into the road and almost under the wheel of a passing hansom. The verdict of the cab-rank was that he had had some sort of stroke. I was so unnerved by this encounter that I went into Covent Garden Market and sat down for some time in a quiet corner by a stall of violets, panting and trembling.

The shop was old-fashioned and low and dark, and the house rose above it for four storeys, dark and dismal. I peered through the window and, seeing no one within, entered. The opening of the door set a clanking bell ringing. I left it open, and walked round a bare costume stand, into a corner behind a cheval glass. For a minute or so no one came. Then I heard heavy feet striding across a room, and a man appeared down the shop.",The Invisible Man,Kemp,NO MONOLOGUE,0,23,Implicit,

880,880,881,NO APPEND,"It was a queer little room, poorly furnished and with a number of big masks in the corner. On the table was his belated breakfast, and it was a confoundedly exasperating thing for me, Kemp, to have to sniff his coffee and stand watching while he came in and resumed his meal. And his table manners were irritating. Three doors opened into the little room, one going upstairs and one down, but they were all shut.

His burden prevented his shutting the door behind him as he would have done; I never saw such a man for shutting doors and I followed him into a very dirty underground kitchen and scullery. I had the pleasure of seeing him begin to wash up, and then, finding no good in keeping down there, and the brick floor being cold on my feet, I returned upstairs and sat in his chair by the fire. It was burning low, and scarcely thinking, I put on a little coal. The noise of this brought him up at once, and he stood aglare. He peered about the room and was within an ace of touching me.

Several rooms I did inspect were unfurnished, and others were littered with theatrical lumber, bought second-hand, I judged, from its appearance. In one room next to his I found a lot of old clothes. I began routing among these, and in my eagerness forgot again the evident sharpness of his ears. I heard a stealthy footstep and, looking up just in time, saw him peering in at the tumbled heap and holding an old-fashioned revolver in his hand. I stood perfectly still while he stared about open-mouthed and suspicious.  It must have been her,  he said slowly.  Damn her! ",The Invisible Man,Kemp,NO MONOLOGUE,0,23,Implicit,

But I decided to inspect the clothes before I did anything further, and my first attempt brought down a pile from an upper shelf. This brought him back, more sinister than ever.

Outside the day was bright by contrast with the brown shadows of the dismal house in which I found myself, dazzlingly bright. A brisk traffic was going by, fruit carts, a hansom, a four-wheeler with a pile of boxes, a fishmonger s cart. I turned with spots of colour swimming before my eyes to the shadowy fixtures behind me.
