8,8,8," I said, earnestly. ","But consider! /newquote Count the cost! Your brain may, as you say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological and morbid process, which involves increased tissue-change and may at last leave a permanent weakness. You know, too, what a black reaction comes upon you. Surely the game is hardly worth the candle. Why should you, for a mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great powers with which you have been endowed? Remember that I speak not only as one comrade to another, but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to some extent answerable.",Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,I said
10,10,10," he said, ","My mind, /newquote rebels at stagnation.

When Gregson or Lestrade or Athelney Jones are out of their depths which, by the way, is their normal state the matter is laid before me. I examine the data, as an expert, and pronounce a specialist s opinion. I claim no credit in such cases. My name figures in no newspaper. The work itself, the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers, is my highest reward. But you have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the Jefferson Hope case.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he answered
13,13,13," said I, cordially. ","Yes, indeed, /newquote I was never so struck by anything in my life. I even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhat fantastic title of  A Study in Scarlet. ",Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,said I
14,14,14,He shook his head sadly.  /newquote  said he. ,"I glanced over it, /newquote Honestly, I cannot congratulate you upon it. Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science, and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner.

18,18,18," said Holmes, after a while, filling up his old brier-root pipe.  /newquote  He tossed over, as he spoke, a crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper.

He has all the Celtic power of quick intuition, but he is deficient in the wide range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments of his art. The case was concerned with a will, and possessed some features of interest. I was able to refer him to two parallel cases, the one at Riga in 1857, and the other at St. Louis in 1871, which have suggested to him the true solution.

20,20,20," said Sherlock Holmes, lightly. ","Oh, he rates my assistance too highly, /newquote He has considerable gifts himself.

Here, for example, is one  Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of the Various Tobaccoes.  In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar-, cigarette-, and pipe-tobacco, with coloured plates illustrating the difference in the ash. It is a point which is continually turning up in criminal trials, and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a clue. If you can say definitely, for example, that some murder has been done by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah, it obviously narrows your field of search. To the trained eye there is as much difference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff of bird s-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he cried

24,24,24,NO APPEND,"I appreciate their importance. Here is my monograph upon the tracing of footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as a preserver of impresses. Here, too, is a curious little work upon the influence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with lithotypes of the hands of slaters, sailors, corkcutters, compositors, weavers, and diamond-polishers. That is a matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective, especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or in discovering the antecedents of criminals. But I weary you with my hobby.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Implicit,
25,25,25," I answered, earnestly. ","Not at all, /newquote It is of the greatest interest to me, especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your practical application of it. But you spoke just now of observation and deduction. Surely the one to some extent implies the other.",Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,I answered
26,26,26," he answered, leaning back luxuriously in his arm-chair, and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe. ","Why, hardly, /newquote For example, observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street Post-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there you dispatched a telegram.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he answered
27,27,27, said I. ,"Right! /newquote Right on both points! But I confess that I don t see how you arrived at it. It was a sudden impulse upon my part, and I have mentioned it to no one.",Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,said I
28,28,28," he remarked, chuckling at my surprise, ","It is simplicity itself, /newquote so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous; and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction. Observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep. Just opposite the Seymour Street Office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering. The earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found, as far as I know, nowhere else in the neighbourhood. So much is observation. The rest is deduction.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he remarked

30,30,30,NO APPEND,"Why, of course I knew that you had not written a letter, since I sat opposite to you all morning. I see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post-cards. What could you go into the post-office for, then, but to send a wire? Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Implicit,
31,31,31," I replied, after a little thought. ","In this case it certainly is so, /newquote The thing, however, is, as you say, of the simplest. Would you think me impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test?",Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,I replied

33,33,33,NO APPEND,"I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it.

36,36,36, I answered.  /newquote  In my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and impotent excuse to cover his failure. What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch?,"You are right, /newquote It was cleaned before being sent to me.",Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,I answered
37,37,37," he observed, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes. ","Though unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren, /newquote Subject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother, who inherited it from your father.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,he observed

39,39,39,NO APPEND,"Quite so. The W. suggests your own name. The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch: so it was made for the last generation. Jewelry usually descends to the eldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as the father. Your father has, if I remember right, been dead many years. It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Implicit,
40,40,40, said I. ,"Right, so far, /newquote Anything else?",Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,said I
41,41,41,NO APPEND,"He was a man of untidy habits, very untidy and careless.

That is all I can gather.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Implicit,
43,43,43, I said. ,"This is unworthy of you, Holmes, /newquote I could not have believed that you would have descended to this. You have made inquires into the history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way. You cannot expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch! It is unkind, and, to speak plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.",Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,I said
44,44,44," said he, kindly, ","My dear doctor, /newquote pray accept my apologies. Viewing the matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you. I assure you, however, that I never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Anaphoric,said he
45,45,45,NO APPEND,Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts? They are absolutely correct in every particular.,Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Implicit,
46,46,46,NO APPEND,"Ah, that is good luck. I could only say what was the balance of probability. I did not at all expect to be so accurate.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Implicit,
47,47,47,NO APPEND,But it was not mere guess-work?,Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Implicit,
48,48,48,NO APPEND,"No, no: I never guess. It is a shocking habit, destructive to the logical faculty. What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend. For example, I began by stating that your brother was careless. When you observe the lower part of that watch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places, but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket. Surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man. Neither is it a very far-fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Implicit,
50,50,50,NO APPEND,"It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take a watch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the inside of the case. It is more handy than a label, as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed. There are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case. Inference, that your brother was often at low water. Secondary inference, that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he could not have redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the inner plate, which contains the key-hole. Look at the thousands of scratches all round the hole, marks where the key has slipped. What sober man s key could have scored those grooves? But you will never see a drunkard s watch without them. He winds it at night, and he leaves these traces of his unsteady hand. Where is the mystery in all this?",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Implicit,
51,51,51, I answered. ,"It is as clear as daylight, /newquote I regret the injustice which I did you. I should have had more faith in your marvellous faculty.

52,52,52,NO APPEND,"None. Hence the cocaine. I cannot live without brain-work. What else is there to live for? Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary, dismal, unprofitable world? See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the dun-coloured houses. What could be more hopelessly prosaic and material? What is the use of having powers, doctor, when one has no field upon which to exert them? Crime is commonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,1,Implicit,

Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London. Four years later Sholto dies. _Within a week of his death_ Captain Morstan s daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeated from year to year, and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a wronged woman. What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father? And why should the presents begin immediately after Sholto s death, unless it is that Sholto s heir knows something of the mystery and desires to make compensation? Have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts?",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,3,Implicit,
104,104,104,NO APPEND,"But what a strange compensation! And how strangely made! Why, too, should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago? Again, the letter speaks of giving her justice.

Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened a stout cord to the mongrel s collar, and led him to the foot of the water-barrel. The creature instantly broke into a succession of high, tremulous yelps, and, with his nose on the ground, and his tail in the air, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and kept us at the top of our speed.","Here you are, doggy!

I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace them in many different ways. This, however, is the readiest and, since fortune has put it into our hands, I should be culpable if I neglected it. It has, however, prevented the case from becoming the pretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be. There might have been some credit to be gained out of it, but for this too palpable clue.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Explicit,said Holmes
357,357,357, said I. ,"There is credit, and to spare, /newquote I assure you, Holmes, that I marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, even more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The thing seems to me to be deeper and more inexplicable. How, for example, could you describe with such confidence the wooden-legged man?",Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Anaphoric,said I
358,358,358,NO APPEND,"Pshaw, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself. I don t wish to be theatrical. It is all patent and above-board. Two officers who are in command of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried treasure. A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan Small. You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain Morstan s possession. He had signed it in behalf of himself and his associates, the sign of the four, as he somewhat dramatically called it. Aided by this chart, the officers or one of them gets the treasure and brings it to England, leaving, we will suppose, some condition under which he received it unfulfilled. Now, then, why did not Jonathan Small get the treasure himself? The answer is obvious. The chart is dated at a time when Morstan was brought into close association with convicts. Jonathan Small did not get the treasure because he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not get away.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Implicit,
359,359,359, said I.,"But that is mere speculation,",Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Anaphoric,said I
360,360,360,NO APPEND,"It is more than that. It is the only hypothesis which covers the facts. Let us see how it fits in with the sequel. Major Sholto remains at peace for some years, happy in the possession of his treasure. Then he receives a letter from India which gives him a great fright. What was that?",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Implicit,
361,361,361,NO APPEND,A letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free.,Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Implicit,
362,362,362,NO APPEND,"Or had escaped. That is much more likely, for he would have known what their term of imprisonment was. It would not have been a surprise to him. What does he do then? He guards himself against a wooden-legged man, a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a white tradesman for him, and actually fires a pistol at him. Now, only one white man s name is on the chart. The others are Hindoos or Mohammedans. There is no other white man. Therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden-legged man is identical with Jonathan Small. Does the reasoning strike you as being faulty?",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Implicit,
363,363,363,NO APPEND,No: it is clear and concise.,Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Implicit,
364,364,364,NO APPEND,"Well, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. Let us look at it from his point of view. He comes to England with the double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having his revenge upon the man who had wronged him. He found out where Sholto lived, and very possibly he established communications with some one inside the house. There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen. Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could not find out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever knew, save the major and one faithful servant who had died. Suddenly Small learns that the major is on his death-bed. In a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes his way to the dying man s window, and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his two sons. Mad with hate, however, against the dead man, he enters the room that night, searches his private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure, and finally leaves a momento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card. He had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder, but, from the point of view of the four associates, something in the nature of an act of justice. Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime, and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal. Do you follow all this?",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Implicit,
365,365,365,NO APPEND,Very clearly.,Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Implicit,
366,366,366,NO APPEND,"Now, what could Jonathan Small do? He could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure. Possibly he leaves England and only comes back at intervals. Then comes the discovery of the garret, and he is instantly informed of it. We again trace the presence of some confederate in the household. Jonathan, with his wooden leg, is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of Bartholomew Sholto. He takes with him, however, a rather curious associate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his naked foot into creasote, whence comes Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer with a damaged tendo Achillis.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Implicit,
367,367,367,NO APPEND,"But it was the associate, and not Jonathan, who committed the crime.",Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Implicit,
368,368,368,NO APPEND,"Quite so. And rather to Jonathan s disgust, to judge by the way he stamped about when he got into the room. He bore no grudge against Bartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if he could have been simply bound and gagged. He did not wish to put his head in a halter. There was no help for it, however: the savage instincts of his companion had broken out, and the poison had done its work: so Jonathan Small left his record, lowered the treasure-box to the ground, and followed it himself. That was the train of events as far as I can decipher them. Of course as to his personal appearance he must be middle-aged, and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an oven as the Andamans. His height is readily calculated from the length of his stride, and we know that he was bearded. His hairiness was the one point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him at the window. I don t know that there is anything else.",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Implicit,
369,369,369,NO APPEND,The associate?,Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Implicit,
370,370,370,NO APPEND,"Ah, well, there is no great mystery in that. But you will know all about it soon enough. How sweet the morning air is! See how that one little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo. Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank. It shines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on a stranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of nature! Are you well up in your Jean Paul?",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Implicit,
371,371,371,NO APPEND,Fairly so. I worked back to him through Carlyle.,Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Implicit,
372,372,372,NO APPEND,"That was like following the brook to the parent lake. He makes one curious but profound remark. It is that the chief proof of man s real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness. It argues, you see, a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a proof of nobility. There is much food for thought in Richter. You have not a pistol, have you?",Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Dr. Watson,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Implicit,
373,373,373,NO APPEND,I have my stick.,Dr. Watson,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,NO MONOLOGUE,0,7,Implicit,
